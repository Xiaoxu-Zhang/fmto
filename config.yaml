  # Notes:
  # 1. If a configuration was labeled [optional] in the comment, it is not required to specify it in the config file.
  # 2. The 'int|[int]' in the problem parameters' comments means it support multiple values. e.g. 'dim: [3, 5]'.
  # 3. All problem support other parameters (configured in tetci2019) except 'dim'.
  # 4. See README for more instructions.
